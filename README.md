## Solutions Overview

### Question 1: Get Longest String  
Finds the longest string in an array that uses only allowed characters (without duplicates), by checking each string and tracking the longest valid match.

### Question 2: Unique Ways to Sum  
Uses backtracking to count how many unique subsets of numbers sum to a target, ensuring each element is used at most once.

### Question 3: Can Make Array All Zero  
Simulates subtracting the first element from the rest repeatedly, checking if all others can be reduced to zero using this method.

### Question 4: First Unique Product  
Uses a `LinkedHashMap` to track the count of each product while maintaining order, and returns the first one that appears only once.

### Question 5: Closest Minimums Distance  
Finds all positions of the smallest value in the array, and returns the smallest distance between any two of those positions.

### Question 6: Three Most Common Words  
Parses the sentence by cleaning punctuation and casing, counts frequency of each word, and returns the top 3 most frequent words (sorted alphabetically in case of ties).

### Question 7: Rotate Linked List  
Rotates a singly linked list to the right by `n` steps using pointer rewiringâ€”efficiently finds the new head and re-links the list.
